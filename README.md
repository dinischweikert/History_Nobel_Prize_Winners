## About
The Nobel Prize is awarded yearly to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace, with the first prize awarded in 1901. Are there any biases in the way the honors are awarded? Use your data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize.

The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.

The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the nobel.csv file in the data folder.

## Analysis

  * Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.
* Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
  * Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.
* Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
  * Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.
* Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
